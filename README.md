==================

Wordpress Plugin for custom fields

This plugin adds a Choose Media button to the Custom Fields area of Post Edit screen.

Clicking the button brings up the Media Library, where you can choose a media object. Once you've selected your media object, it will insert the URL into the custom field value box.
