kats-custom-fields
==================

Wordpress Plugin for custom fields

This plugin adds a Choose Media button to the Custom Fields area of Post Edit screen. In order for the button to show, the custom field name must contain the words "url","file","pdf","icon"

Clicking the button brings up the Media Library, where you can choose a media object. Once you've selected your media object, it will insert the URL into the custom field value box.
